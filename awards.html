	<span id="h-2">Architectural Products Magazine Product Innovations Award (PIA): Recognizing Technology Innovation</span><br><br>
	<p>These awards determine and honor the most innovative LED and solid-state luminaires and fixtures on the market, while also recognizing the players behind the components that make up these light sources. The Architectural SSL Product Innovation Awards will also recognize leaders in categories ranging from those conducting cutting-edge R+D, to those helping in the development of standards, to those pushing to make solid-state lighting a truly sustainable technology.<br><br> The Architectural SSL Product Innovation Awards reveal the criteria and characteristics of the technology that matters. One of the barriers hindering adoption of SSL and LED products among the architectural and lighting design community is an uncertainty about the quality of products available, or in many cases, ignorance of what is available. Architectural SSL magazine along with their judging panel reviewed all entered products across range of common criteria. The award winners represent a peer- recognized selection of quality products that the architectural and lighting design community can feel comfortable specifying.<br><br>GLOWDIM® Technology, Moda’s new Dim to Warm technology won the 2017 Architectural SSL Drivers & Controls Innovation of the year. GLOWDIM is much more than just dim to warm. GLOWDIM enabled fixtures dims smoothly from 2700K to 1800K, maintaining a CRI of 96-98 and dimming from 100% to 0% with most 0-10V dimmers and dimming systems. It is this ability to create precise illumination with smooth fading to black, following the incandescent curve down to 0% coupled with simple wiring which is why GLOWDIM won the PIA ’17 Award for Drivers & Controls.</p></div>
