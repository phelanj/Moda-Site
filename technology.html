		<p class="readBlock">Huge corporations which make LEDs control the lighting industry. These companies are controlling the lighting specification market and are doing a poor job. Their focus is on smart phones, tablets, computers and televisions. This industry uses many more LEDs than the lighting sector. The lighting industry is actually very small for them. So why allow these companies to dictate what we see? Most of us are forced to accept that. But for Moda this makes no sense.<span id="dots3">..</span><span id="more" class="more3"><br><br>Making our own LEDs to our own specifications and requirements makes a lot more sense. This is where Moda began to make our own LEDs. None of us thought we would be doing this. The LEDs that are available are red, green, blue, amber, yellow and ultra violet. All others are phosphor mixes. Having a deep knowledge and understanding of mixing phosphor allows us to produce unbeatable LEDs that give a specification grade performance tailored to the high-end lighting industry. We buy the industry leading wafers, manufacture our own components utilizing the very best phosphors from Mitsubishi, and high performance adhesives to produce our own single bin. A real 2 step MacAdam ellipse and super high color rendering index (HCRI) coupled with excellent efficacy dies. These dies are the same and have outstanding R1-R15 values and excellent TM30 results. We are able to make dies never seen before. White LEDs are blue LEDs with a mix of red and green phosphors. The CRI, R1-R15 and TM30 values are dictated by type, quality, and ratio of phosphor mix. Our 1800K (candle light) and 2200K is so clean it successfully renders vibrant colors with clarity. Our 2700K, 3000K, 3500K and 4000K will be unlike any other. 6500K will be something you have never seen before. The heavy blue hue is gone. It is pure and can now be a color to use in the right application. Our dies not only perform well but do not need to be driven hard to produce high lumen output. This keeps the dies cool and phosphor degradation to just 3% in 10 years of continual use. Mono colored dies are not just limited to the standard colors of red, green, blue, amber, yellow and ultra violet. We phosphor coat these dies to produce vibrant static colors of yellow, pink, cyan, violet, turquoise, ice blue, light green and golden yellow. Having static colors now allows a low cost, DMX free installation ideal for fast static color projects. Producing dark colors are difficult and not available, as soon as you add light the color is no longer dark. We have successfully produced two dark color - dark orange and dark blue. These will form part of our new and upcoming dark series.

DMX reflection is no longer a problem as our firmware eliminates all DMX reflection so our terminators no longer require a resistor inside.

		<p class="readBlock" style="margin-bottom: 150px;">Intelligent or tunable white fixtures which focuses on the warmer color temperatures ranging from 1800K to 3000K. Having the ability to have a narrower window of colors allows for superior color rendition in these temperatures keeping the CRI between 90-95 during the transition. R1-R15 are typically in the high nineties and superior TM30 results using standard DMX 512 controllers. Colors can be easily selected and dimmed down to 0%.</p>

		<p class="readBlock">We should all have the best light performance that technology allows for. Packaging our own dies and mixing our own phosphors gives us the ability to make LEDs specific for our products and the specification lighting industry. We are first and unequalled with the ability to Color Rendering Index’s typically in the high 90s without sacrificing efficacy. Precisely what the lighting specifier needs. This is standard within our range and we make no up charges giving you the very best a fixture can be.</p></div>

		<p class="readBlock">At Moda we make our own LEDs and are not reliant on third parties. We control every aspect of their production from wafers, cups, gold wire to complex phosphors and adhesives. We run small batches and are able to make every LED the same - therefore we do not have bins like the large commercial die manufacturers have. Ensuring that every LED is the same time and time again. Bin Free for life which we call Zero Bin.</p>

		<p class="readBlock">CRI is only focused on R1 to R8 colors. But what about the other colors? Many will ask for CRI and R9 values, but this is only part of the picture. Creating our own LEDs allows us to precisely control the rendition of colors. This is vital for the Lighting Industry. Our dies produce incredible R1-R15 values and we have focused on the 99 colors in the TM30-15 chart to make sure our fixtures recreate colors exactly and precisely as they should be seen.</p>

		<p class="readBlock">Our miniature fixtures have a tool-less, self-locking, rotating mounting bracket. In its natural state the mounting brackets’ position is locked. To unlock simply push down on the bracket and the bracket unlocks enabling the installer to rotate the fixture, directing the light beam. When pressure is removed from the bracket, the bracket will lock. Simple, yet smart. Tool-less so you never need to pick up a tool. Patented self-locking smart and secure locking brackets designed exclusively for our fixtures.</p></div>
