	<p>The Pharos VLC is an extremely capable and cost effective solution for large LED pixel arrays; such as building façades, bridges, and presentation walls. It makes it simple to play video content across your array, either from locally stored HD media files or a DVI-D video input. It also offers a range of creative, generative effects and the versatility of powerful show control and integration features.<br><br>The VLC is a rugged 1U 19” rackmount unit with separate Gigabit Ethernet ports for management and DMX-over-Ethernet (eDMX) output. It is available in multiple variants with capacities ranging from 25,600 channels up to a massive 768,000 channels from a single unit, with further scaling by using multiple Controllers connected and synchronized over Ethernet.<br><br>The VLC extends the Pharos range of Controllers as an alternative to the industry-leading Pharos LPC X. While the LPC X provides highly flexible lighting control for large multi-zone lighting systems, the VLC is capable of controlling even larger systems where the fixtures are arranged and controlled as a single array, at our lowest ever price per channel.<br><br>The VLC is an exciting new option at the heart of the fully scalable Pharos system that can be tailored to the needs of your project, with additional integration options supported by our range of Remote Devices. The VLC is programmed using the free Pharos Designer 2 software and existing installations can be managed from anywhere using its built-in web server.</p>
